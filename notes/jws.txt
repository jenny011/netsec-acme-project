All ACME requests with a non-empty body MUST encapsulate their
   payload in a JSON Web Signature (JWS)
signed using the account's private key

The JWS MUST be in the Flattened JSON Serialization

The JWS Protected Header MUST include the following fields:
      *  "alg" (Algorithm)
         +  This field MUST NOT contain "none" or a Message
            Authentication Code (MAC) algorithm (e.g. one in which the
            algorithm registry description mentions MAC/HMAC).
      *  "nonce" (defined in Section 6.5)
      *  "url" (defined in Section 6.4)

      * Either "jwk" (JSON Web Key) or "kid" (Key ID) as specified below
        For newAccount requests, and for revokeCert requests authenticated by a certificate key, there MUST be a "jwk" field.  This field MUST contain the public key corresponding to the private key used to sign the JWS.

		For all other requests, the request is signed using an existing account, and there MUST be a "kid" field.  This field MUST contain the account URL received by POSTing to the newAccount resource.


JWS Signing Input [5]
      The input to the digital signature or MAC computation.  Its value
      is ASCII(BASE64URL(UTF8(JWS Protected Header)) || '.' ||
      BASE64URL(JWS Payload)).
